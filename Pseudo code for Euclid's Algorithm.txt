#pseudo code:
when a and b are integers and a > b,
q is the greatest number of times b fit into a
r is the remainder when b divides a

e.g. a = 84, b = 24

84 / 24 = 3.5
so q = 3

r = a - b*q
so r = 84 - 24*3 = 84 - 72 = 12

all in all, 84 = 24*3 + 12

since r !=0 , we carry on and find gcd(b,r)

24 = 12*q + r

q = floor(b/r) = floor(24/12) = 2
r = 24 - 12*2 = 0

so gcd(a,b) is the value of b in the penultimate iteration
